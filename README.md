# Costa da Caparica Smart Beach Project

## Presentation

The Costa da Caparica Smart Beach Project is an innovative solution that aims to enhance the beach experience for visitors and residents in Costa da Caparica, a popular coastal region. By leveraging technology and data, this project centralizes information about the beaches, provides real-time weather updates, offers personalized beach recommendations, and shares details about local businesses and events. With a focus on the smart city concept, this project aims to improve the overall quality of life in the area.

## Objectives

1. **Centralize Beach Information:** The project consolidates comprehensive information about the beaches in Costa da Caparica, including amenities, accessibility, safety measures, and water quality. This data helps beachgoers make informed decisions and plan their visits effectively.

Additionally, the project features a calendar of events happening at the beaches, including sports tournaments, concerts, and cultural festivals.

5. **Enhanced Safety Measures:** The project incorporates safety features, such as real-time updates on sea conditions, water quality alerts, and notifications about potential hazards. These measures ensure that beachgoers are well-informed and can enjoy their time at the beach with peace of mind.
